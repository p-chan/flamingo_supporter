        <h2>What information will ‘Learners’ see?</h2>
        <p>We need some of your personal information for payments and security reasons, only the information required for people to meet up with you for practicing will be displayed for the public.<br>We gather the information submitted by the ‘supporter’ to create a profile about them.

        <section>
          <h3>Areas you are able to go</h3>
          <p>Information of where ‘supporters’ are able to meet up with ‘learners’ is required to save time and effort finding eachother. ‘Learners’ will, however, still be able to request you, even though they are located in a completely different area.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Your rating</h3>
          <p>‘Learners’ can rate you for your work with them, based on their impression of you, and this will be shown in your profile.</p>

        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>‘Supporters’ will choose the price per hour. (Minimum 1,500 yen/Maximum 5,000 yen)<br>20% of the payment will go to the Flamingo service fee.

        <section>
          <h3>Meeting up with eachother</h3>
          <p>We understand difficulties might occur sometimes. Please review the following.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>If you want to change the place and/or time to meet, cancel and request again, or talk directly with your ‘learner’.</p>
          <p>If you notice you will be late for the appointed meeting, please notify your respective partner as soon as possible. Please note that if you as a supporter keep showing up late, not only will your rating drop, but your account will be shut down.</p>
          <p>If your ‘learner’ is late for the appointed time, you can wait up to 30 minutes. After that the request is to be cancelled, in which case the ‘learner’ will pay a cancellation fee.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Cancelling requests Open the Flamingo app, move to ‘Reservation List’ from the ‘menu’-button and choose ‘Cancel’. If you cancel requests too often, your rating will drop and your account will be shut down. Cancellation fee If a meetup has been accepted and you cancel it before 48 hours in advance, no fee will be charged. If cancelled within 48 hours of the meeting, you will be charged to pay 50% of the set fee. If within 24 hours, you will pay 100% of the fee.</p>
          <p>Enjoy using Flamingo!</p>
